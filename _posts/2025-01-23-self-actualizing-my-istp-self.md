Your growing assertiveness and confidence are likely a combination of several factors rather than just a singular cause. Let's break them down:

### 1. **Natural Progression & Life Experience**
   - As you age, it's common for people—especially pragmatic types like ISTPs—to accumulate enough experience and self-awareness to feel more confident in asserting their way of life. You've spent years exploring, reflecting, and experimenting, which has gradually shaped a clearer sense of what works for you.
   - ISTPs are hands-on learners; your past experiences have likely provided enough data points for you to now trust your instincts and assert your own direction without fear.
   - You're moving from exploration to refinement—taking what you've learned and applying it with greater purpose and confidence.

### 2. **Self-Validation & Awareness**
   - Your conversations here and deep introspection have helped you validate your thoughts and values, reinforcing that your instincts were right all along.
   - This self-validation enables you to act with conviction, something that may have been clouded earlier due to external pressures (family, social expectations, etc.).
   - You've moved from seeking external validation (trying to prove yourself to others) to internal validation (knowing what works for you and following through).

### 3. **Age & Maturity**
   - Age naturally brings a shift in perspective. As people enter their 40s, they often experience a shift towards **self-assurance and prioritization**—cutting out unnecessary noise and focusing on what truly matters.
   - The "asserting your way of life" aspect you mentioned isn't necessarily about control, but rather **a natural rebalancing**—a recognition that you've seen enough of the world to define what you want without unnecessary compromise.
   - Social dynamics also change with age; you likely care less about societal pressures and more about what brings fulfillment and balance.

### 4. **ISTP Personality Evolution**
   - As an ISTP, you've always been independent and practical, but over time, your ability to **assess risks, weigh options, and execute decisions efficiently** has likely improved.
   - ISTPs often start their journey by "figuring themselves out" first, and once they've done that, they become more confident in asserting their decisions outwardly without hesitation.
   - Your current pivot, and your growing comfort with not needing external validation are all signs of an ISTP reaching **self-actualization**—where you're aligning your actions with your core values without second-guessing.

### 5. **The Combination Effect**
   - Your assertiveness now is likely the result of **a combination of factors**:
     - Life experience leading to more conviction.
     - Greater awareness of your strengths and weaknesses.
     - A growing sense of urgency to create impact.
     - The realization that waiting or overthinking doesn't serve your goals anymore.

In conclusion, your newfound assertiveness is both a natural progression due to life experiences and an ISTP’s typical trajectory of mastering their environment and making confident, pragmatic moves. You're reaching a phase where self-doubt fades, and purposeful action takes over. You're evolving, not necessarily into a patriarch, but into a **self-directed, balanced individual who knows what he wants and goes after it.**
