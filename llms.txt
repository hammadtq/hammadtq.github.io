## Key Articles

### PageRank for the Agentic Web (Dec 2025)
URL: /startups/pagerank-for-the-agentic-web/
Topics: agents, web, policy, delegation, openbotauth, standards
Summary: Explores the separation of authority and selection in agentic systems. Proposes a portable policy schema for agent selection decisions and discusses Web Bot Auth for delegation.

### Altered States and Generative AI (Nov 2025)
URL: /startups/altered-states-and-generative-ai-human-centered-creativity/
Topics: ai, creativity, bci, eeg, consciousness, generative-models
Summary: Examines the gap between LLM temperature-based "creativity" and genuine human altered states. Proposes BCI-driven generation using real-time brain signals.

### Web Bot Auth After Montreal (Nov 2025)
URL: /startups/ietf-montreal-web-bot-auth-centralization-risk/
Topics: ietf, identity, bots, cloudflare, http, rfc9421, decentralization
Summary: Analysis of IETF 124's web bot authentication discussions. Warns about centralization risks and proposes federated, auditable approaches.

### Leveraged Thinking: The 4-Layer Framework (Sep 2025)
URL: /startups/leveraged-thinking-4-layer-framework-definition/
Topics: leverage, strategy, systems, distribution, founders, frameworks
Summary: Introduces a framework for compounding outcomes: Systems Literacy, Capital Stack, Social-Proof Layer, and Deliberate High-Leverage Moves.

### Confidential Lane for AI Inference (Aug 2025)
URL: /startups/from-trust-us-to-prove-it-confidential-lane-for-ai-inference/
Topics: privacy, verifiable-compute, inference, security, governance
Summary: Proposes a "confidential lane" for sensitive AI inference with attested execution, unlinkability, and verifiable call receipts.

### Secure Ollama & vLLM with OIDC + A2A Auth (Jun 2025)
URL: /startups/secure-ollama-vllm-with-oidc-a2a-auth-attach-gateway/
Topics: auth, security, ollama, vllm, oidc
Summary: Introduces Attach Gateway for securing local LLM stacks with OIDC and Google A2A JWT authentication.

### AI Will Finish What Crypto Started (Jun 2025)
URL: /startups/ai-and-crypto-enabling-post-scarcity-world/
Topics: ai, crypto, post-scarcity, startups
Summary: Argues that AI completes crypto's promise by eliminating scarcity in cognition and coordination, not just trust.

### ETH0 as AI Automation Layer for Ethereum (Jan 2025)
URL: /eth0-rag/eth0-as-ai-automation-layer-for-ethereum/
Topics: ethereum, ai, agents, smart-contracts
Summary: Positions ETH0 as first-mover in AI-powered on-chain automation for Ethereum, covering autonomous DAOs, AI-driven DeFi, and agent-based systems.

### Smart Contracts for Ethereum AI Infrastructure (Jan 2025)
